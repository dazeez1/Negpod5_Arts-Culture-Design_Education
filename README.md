Our mission focus for this trimester is art, designs, and culture, and our project is an Art Gallery Application. This project could help individuals interested in arts and designs to have access to various arts and knowledge to learn more about culture through works of art. This will provide a space that allows for social engagement, creating a platform for dialogue and appreciation of diverse artistic perspectives. Overall, the application would present the user with a dynamic platform that grants access to a diverse range of artworks and allows them to add different reviews on different art pieces.
